# PyCafe Menu and Ordering System â˜•
### Video Demo:  <https://youtu.be/kyk3BNCzKZ4>
## Description:

***PyCafe*** is a simple application that computes the total order cost, shows a menu of available foods, and accepts customer orders. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate fundamental Python ideas and capabilities, like file management, input from users, and data processing. The user is prompted to enter the food products along with their quantities. In addition to determining the total cost based on the goods and amounts ordered, it verifies if the submitted food item is available on the menu. The user is prompted again and again until they input "done."
